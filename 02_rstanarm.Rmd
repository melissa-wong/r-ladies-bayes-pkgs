## Description

## Environment Setup
```{r setup, results="hide", message=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

set.seed(123)
options("scipen" = 1, "digits" = 4)

library(tidyverse)
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

library(rstanarm)
library(bayesplot)
```

## Linear Model (Default Priors)

### Define Model

Let's start with the following simple linear model:

\begin{align*}
  mpg \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \\
  \mu = a + b*disp \\
\end{align*}

The _stan_glm_ function from the _rstanarm_ package fits a Bayesian linear model.  The syntax is very similar to _lm_.

```{r mdl1, results='hide'}
mdl1 <- stan_glm(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)
```
### Prior Predictive Distribution

Next, I'll examine the prior predictive distribution to see if the default priors seem reasonable.  The _prior_summary_ function shows the default priors for the model as well as the adjusted priors after automatic scaling.  See http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html if you are interested in the details about how the default and adjusted priors are calculated. 

```{r}
prior_summary(mdl1)
```

```{r}
# Plot prior predictive distribution using adjusted priors
N <- 100

prior_samples <- data.frame(a = rnorm(N, 20, 15),
                            b = rnorm(N, 0, 0.12))

D <- seq(min(mtcars$disp), max(mtcars$disp), length.out = N)

res <- as.data.frame(apply(prior_samples, 1, function(x) x[1] + x[2] * (D-230.7))) %>%
  mutate(disp = D) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=c(-"disp"), names_to="iter") 

res %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=disp, y=value, group=iter), alpha=0.2) +
  labs(x="disp", y="prior predictive mpg")
```

Hmm, I notice two things in the prior predictive distribution which seem unrealistic given real-world knowledge: 1) negative mpg and 2) increasing mpg as displacement increases. Later on I'll choose a more informative prior that incorporates this additional knowledge. But let's proceed with the analysis to see what happens.

### Diagnostics

I'll walk through the steps for manually extracting the diagnostic information from the _mdl1_ object since I think that can be helpful to understand exactly what's going on.  However, once you have a handle on these steps I highly recommend the ```shinystan``` package; it will automatically create all of these diagnostic plots (and more) with an nice interactive web interface.

Once the model has been fit, either _as.matrix_ or _as.array_ extracts the posterior draws.  The key difference is that _as.array_ keeps the chains separate. Note that the default is 4 chains, but you can change that parameter in _stan_glm_.

```{r}
post <- as.array(mdl1)
str(post)
```

#### Trace Plots
The _bayesplot_ package provides the function _mcmc_trace_ which plots the MCMC draws.

```{r}
mcmc_trace(post, pars=c("disp", "sigma"))
```

There are three things I am looking for in the trace plot of each chain:

  1. *Good mixing* -  In other words, the chain is rapidly changing values across the full region versus getting "stuck" near a particular value and slowly changing.
  
  2. *Stationarity* - The mean of the chain is relatively stable.
  
  3. *Convergence* - All of the chains spend most of the time around the same high-probability value.
    
The trace plots above look good. 

#### Trace Rank Plots

It can sometimes be had to interpret the trace plots when there are many chains. An alternative is the _mcmc_rank_overlay_ function.  This function plots a trace rank plot which is the distribution of the ranked samples.

```{r}
mcmc_rank_overlay(mdl1, pars=c("disp", "sigma"))
```

#### Effective Sample Size and $\hat{R}$

The _summary_ function displays _n_eff_ and $\hat{R}$ for the object returned by _stan_glm_.

```{r}
summary(mdl1)
```

Since MCMC samples are usually correlated, the effective sample size (_n_eff_) is often less than the number of samples. There is no hard and fast rule for what is an acceptable number for _n_eff_. McElreath’s guidance is it depends on what you are trying to estimate. If you are interested mostly in the posterior mean, then _n_eff_ = 200 can be enough. But if you are interested in the tails of the distribution and it’s highly skewed then you’ll need _n_eff_ to be much larger. There are two parameters, _iter_ and _warmup_, which you can adjust in _stan_glm_ if a larger _n_eff_ is needed.

### Posterior Distribution

Since the chains, _n_eff_ and $\hat{R} look good, I'll examine the posterior distributions next.

```{r}
# Posterior point estimates (medians are used for point estimates)
coef(mdl1)
```

```{r}
# 95% credible intervals
knitr::kable(posterior_interval(mdl1, prob=0.95))
```

### Posterior Predictive Distribution

The _posterior_predict_ function draws samples from the posterior predictive distribution. The ```shinystan``` package will generate nice plots of the posterior predictive distribution.

In this case, I'm going to plot the expected value of the posterior predictive distribution and overlay the observations since I think it can be easier for a beginner to these methods to understand. The _posterior_linpred_ function returns the linear predictor, possibly transformed by the inverse-link function.  The _posterior_epred_ function returns the expectation over the posterior predictive distribution. In this example, the model is a Gaussian likelihood with an identity link function, so the two functions return identical results.

```{r}
newdata <- data.frame(disp=seq(min(mtcars$disp), max(mtcars$disp)))

y_rep <- as.data.frame(t(posterior_epred(mdl1, newdata=newdata, draws=50))) %>%
  cbind(newdata) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=starts_with("V"), names_to="grp", values_to="mpg")

y_rep %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=disp, y=mpg)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=grp), alpha=0.2) +
  geom_point(data = mtcars) 
```
